# SimpleASRmodel
A simple CRDNN based ASR model trained on TIMIT. I created this repository for my own understanding of how ASR models work and how they were trained before the innovation of many advanced learning techniques such as self-supervised learning etc. 
[Work in progress (WIP)] If anyone finds any error or have any suggestion please do let me know.
